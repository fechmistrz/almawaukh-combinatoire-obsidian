The Schröder–Hipparchus numbers may be used to count several closely related combinatorial objects:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-stan-ec-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-ss-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-eth-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-4)

- The _n_th number in the sequence counts the different ways of subdividing a polygon with _n_ + 1 sides into smaller polygons by adding diagonals of the original polygon.
- The _n_th number counts the different [plane trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_\(graph_theory\) "Tree (graph theory)") with _n_ leaves and with all internal vertices having two or more children.
- The _n_th number counts the different ways of inserting parentheses into a sequence of _n_ + 1 symbols, with each pair of parentheses surrounding two or more symbols or parenthesized groups, and without any parentheses surrounding the entire sequence.
- The _n_th number counts the faces of all dimensions of an [associahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associahedron "Associahedron") _K__n_ + 1 of dimension _n_ − 1, including the associahedron itself as a face, but not including the empty set. For instance, the two-dimensional associahedron _K_4 is a [pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon "Pentagon"); it has five vertices, five faces, and one whole associahedron, for a total of 11 faces.

As the figure shows, there is a simple combinatorial equivalence between these objects: a polygon subdivision has a plane tree as a form of its [dual graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph "Dual graph"), the leaves of the tree correspond to the symbols in a parenthesized sequence, and the internal nodes of the tree other than the root correspond to parenthesized groups. The parenthesized sequence itself may be written around the perimeter of the polygon with its symbols on the sides of the polygon and with parentheses at the endpoints of the selected diagonals. This equivalence provides a [bijective proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_proof "Bijective proof") that all of these kinds of objects are counted by a single integer sequence.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-ss-2)

The same numbers also count the [double permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Double_permutation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Double permutation (page does not exist)") (sequences of the numbers from 1 to _n_, each number appearing twice, with the first occurrences of each number in sorted order) that avoid the [permutation patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_pattern "Permutation pattern") 12312 and 121323.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-5)

The closely related [large Schröder numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der_number "Schröder number") are equal to twice the Schröder–Hipparchus numbers, and may also be used to count several types of combinatorial objects including certain kinds of lattice paths, partitions of a rectangle into smaller rectangles by recursive slicing, and parenthesizations in which a pair of parentheses surrounding the whole sequence of elements is also allowed. The [Catalan numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number "Catalan number") also count closely related sets of objects including subdivisions of a polygon into triangles, plane trees in which all internal nodes have exactly two children, and parenthesizations in which each pair of parentheses surrounds exactly two symbols or parenthesized groups.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-eth-3)

The sequence of Catalan numbers and the sequence of Schröder–Hipparchus numbers, viewed as infinite-dimensional [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_vector "Row vector"), are the unique [eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector "Eigenvector") for the first two in a sequence of naturally defined linear operators on number sequences.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-bs-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-coker-7) More generally, the _k_th sequence in this sequence of integer sequences is (_x_1, _x_2, _x_3, ...) where the numbers _xn_ are calculated as the sums of [Narayana numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narayana_number "Narayana number") multiplied by powers of _k_. This can be expressed as a [hypergeometric function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_function "Hypergeometric function"):

xn=∑i=1nN(n,i)ki−1=∑i=1n1n(ni)(ni−1)ki−1=2F1(1−n,−n;2;k).![{\displaystyle x_{n}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}N(n,i)\,k^{i-1}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{n}}{n \choose i}{n \choose i-1}k^{i-1}={}_{2}F_{1}(1-n,-n;2;k).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9c234349a83e2c88e0e30811b56a92a69cad461)

Substituting _k_ = 1 into this formula gives the Catalan numbers and substituting _k_ = 2 into this formula gives the Schröder–Hipparchus numbers.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-coker-7)

In connection with the property of Schröder–Hipparchus numbers of counting faces of an associahedron, the number of vertices of the associahedron is given by the Catalan numbers. The corresponding numbers for the [permutohedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutohedron "Permutohedron") are respectively the [ordered Bell numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_Bell_number "Ordered Bell number") and the [factorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial "Factorial").

## Recurrence

As well as the summation formula above, the Schröder–Hipparchus numbers may be defined by a [recurrence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation "Recurrence relation"):

xn=1n((6n−9)xn−1−(n−3)xn−2).![{\displaystyle x_{n}={\frac {1}{n}}\left((6n-9)x_{n-1}-(n-3)x_{n-2}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c7046300d3ae7ec349e0fc684770ec66e2c3e3bc)

Stanley proves this fact using [generating functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function "Generating function")[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-stan-amm-8) while Foata and Zeilberger provide a direct combinatorial proof.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-9)


[Plutarch's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch%27s "Plutarch's") dialogue [Table Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_Talk_\(Plutarch\) "Table Talk (Plutarch)") contains the line:

Chrysippus says that the number of compound propositions that can be made from only ten simple propositions exceeds a million. (Hipparchus, to be sure, refuted this by showing that on the affirmative side there are 103,049 compound statements, and on the negative side 310,952.)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-stan-amm-8)

This statement went unexplained until 1994, when David Hough, a graduate student at [George Washington University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University "George Washington University"), observed that there are 103049 ways of inserting parentheses into a sequence of ten items.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-stan-ec-1)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-stan-amm-8)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-acerbi-10) The historian of mathematics Fabio Acerbi ([CNRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNRS "CNRS")) has shown that a similar explanation can be provided for the other number: it is very close to the average of the tenth and eleventh Schröder–Hipparchus numbers, 310954, and counts bracketings of ten terms together with a negative particle.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-acerbi-10)

The problem of counting parenthesizations was introduced to modern mathematics by [Schröder (1870)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#CITEREFSchr%C3%B6der1870).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-11)

Plutarch's recounting of Hipparchus's two numbers records a disagreement between Hipparchus and the earlier Stoic philosopher [Chrysippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus "Chrysippus"), who had claimed that the number of compound propositions that can be made from 10 simple propositions exceeds a million. Contemporary philosopher [Susanne Bobzien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanne_Bobzien "Susanne Bobzien") ([2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#CITEREFBobzien2011)) has argued that Chrysippus's calculation was the correct one, based on her analysis of [Stoic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_logic "Stoic logic"). Bobzien reconstructs the calculations of both Chrysippus and Hipparchus, and says that showing how Hipparchus got his mathematics correct but his Stoic logic wrong can cast new light on the Stoic notions of conjunctions and assertibles.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number#cite_note-Bobzien-12)
