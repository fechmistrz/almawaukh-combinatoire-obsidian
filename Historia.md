In Greece, [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch") wrote that [Xenocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocrates "Xenocrates") of [Chalcedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedon "Chalcedon") (396–314 BC) discovered the number of different [syllables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable "Syllable") possible in the [Greek language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"). This would have been the first attempt on record to solve a difficult problem in [permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation "Permutation") and [combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination "Combination").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_combinatorics#cite_note-2) The claim, however, is implausible: this is one of the few mentions of combinatorics in [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece"), and the number they found, 1.002 × 10 12, seems too round to be more than a guess.

Later, an argument between [Chrysippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus "Chrysippus") (3rd century BC) and [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus") (2nd century BC) of a rather delicate [enumerative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration "Enumeration")problem, which was later shown to be related to [Schröder–Hipparchus numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Hipparchus_number "Schröder–Hipparchus number"), is mentioned.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_combinatorics#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_combinatorics#cite_note-6) There is also evidence that in the _[Ostomachion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostomachion "Ostomachion")_, [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") (3rd century BC) considered the configurations of a [tiling puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_puzzle "Tiling puzzle"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_combinatorics#cite_note-7) while some combinatorial interests may have been present in lost works of [Apollonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_combinatorics#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_combinatorics#cite_note-9)
